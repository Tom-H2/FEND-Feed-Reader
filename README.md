# Feedreader Project Overview

This project was completed by Tom Harris as partial fulfillment of the Udacity FEND Certification. Jasmine 2.1.2 was used to develop a basic testing process, and to familiarize me with the idea of testing code.

All the work here represents my work. But I could not have finished this project without the support of my Udacity Study Group, [The Matthew Cranford tutorial](https://matthewcranford.com/feed-reader-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code/), and [RyanB's walkthrough](https://youtu.be/7kOBXPbDmyw).

I also want to acknowledge and thank Janice Medina for posting her [Diigo Outliner](https://www.diigo.com/outliner/fjsk23/Udacity-Feed-Reader-Testing-(project-%234)?key=i5xqspbzvg) that helped me find a few of the links mentioned above.

For understanding Asynchronous Work I used [Jasmine tutorials](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/async).

## How to view this project

1. Open the file 'index.html' in a browser. The title *UdaciFeeds* will appear.
2. Scroll to the bottom on the browser page to view the Jasmine.
3. The Jasmine Test Suites appear there.
4. The code for the tests can be found in the feedreader.js file.

## What I learned

I have learned to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. Since my first introduction to JavaScript I have wanted a way to test my code and I feel that Jasmine will be an essential part of my FEND development.

### I used the list of tasks below to keep track of the required parts. As I completed each task I used *strikethrough* to show it as completed.

~~1. Take the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)
2. Download the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
3. Review the functionality of the application within your browser.
4. Explore the application's HTML (**./index.html**), CSS (**./css/style.css**) and JavaScript (**./js/app.js**) to gain an understanding of how it works.
5. Explore the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).
6. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in **./js/app.js** to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.
7. Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state.
8. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
9. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
10. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
11. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
12. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
13. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
14. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
15. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
16. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
17. No test should be dependent on the results of another.
18. Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
19. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
20. When complete - all of your tests should pass.
21. Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage),  provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.~~
